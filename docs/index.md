# Welcome to Simpl

The Simpl framework is composed of three major parts:

1. The `Simpl-Games-API` service: a single instance running for all simulations, providing user information and storage to the model services

2. The `Simpl-modelservice` Python framework used to build simulation model services.

3. The `Simpl-react` npm module, a module providing components for building UIs that interact with a simulation model service.

Some repos are provided as examples of how to build simulations using Simpl:

1. `simpl-calc-model` is an example of a single player simulation model service.

2. `simpl-calc-ui` is an example of a browser-based UI for a single player simulation model service.
